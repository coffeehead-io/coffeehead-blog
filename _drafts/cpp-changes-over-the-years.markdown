I admit I haven't been using C++ for 10 years or so. Many things changed and it changed for good.
The time has come to change it. Some time ago I got interested in cryptocurrencies and all that blockchain stuff like
Bitcoin, Ethereum and its virtual machine. 

I thought it would be good to be up to speed with C++. It's still very popular, especially when coding operating systems
or projects based on blockchain. I was always interested in Linux and low level programming but didn't have time for it
no to even mention writing blogposts about it.

The truth is that most of the projects based on blockchain are coded in C/C++. Some even say it's the fastest programming language in
the blockchain world.

In this article I'm gonna show how C++ looks like currently, What changed over the years and what I'm gonna do with this
knowledge.

I'm not going to talk about basics like types, operators and so on...
I'm going to talk about more advanced language features that will help us code some blockchain pet project.


Please keep reading!
